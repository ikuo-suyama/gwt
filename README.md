# gwt - Git Worktree Manager

A powerful CLI tool for managing Git worktrees with ease. Simplify your multi-branch workflow with intuitive commands and interactive interfaces.

## Features

- 🌳 **Easy Worktree Creation** - Create worktrees with a single command
- 🔄 **Auto-Rebase** - Automatically rebase new worktrees to the latest base branch
- 📋 **Interactive List** - Browse and manage worktrees with an interactive UI
- 🎯 **Smart Branch Detection** - Automatically detects default branch and base branch
- 📦 **Environment File Copying** - Automatically copy .env files to new worktrees
- ⚡ **Fast Switching** - Quickly switch between worktrees
- 🧹 **Cleanup Tools** - Prune and delete worktrees easily

## Installation

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g gwt
```

### Local Installation

```bash
npm install gwt
```

### Using npx (No Installation Required)

```bash
npx gwt add feature/new-feature
```

## Usage

### Create a New Worktree

Create a worktree for a new or existing branch:

```bash
# Create worktree with branch name
gwt add feature/auth

# Create worktree using current branch
gwt add

# Create worktree without auto-rebase
gwt add feature/auth --no-rebase

# Create worktree without copying .env files
gwt add feature/auth --no-env

# Specify custom base branch
gwt add feature/auth --base develop

# Specify custom worktree path
gwt add feature/auth --path /path/to/worktree
```

**Note**: You must use the `add` subcommand explicitly. Running `gwt` without a subcommand shows help.

### List Worktrees

Display all worktrees:

```bash
gwt list
# or
gwt ls
```

This shows all worktrees with their paths, branches, commits, and status.

### Delete a Worktree

```bash
# Delete with interactive selection
gwt delete
# or
gwt rm

# Delete specific worktree
gwt delete /path/to/worktree

# Force delete (skip confirmation)
gwt delete /path/to/worktree --force
# or
gwt delete /path/to/worktree -f
```

### Switch to a Worktree

```bash
# Switch with interactive selection
gwt switch
# or
gwt sw

# Switch to specific worktree
gwt switch /path/to/worktree
```

**Note**: For directory switching to work, add shell integration (see below).

### Sync Current Branch

Rebase current branch to the latest base branch:

```bash
gwt sync

# Specify custom base branch
gwt sync --base develop
```

### Cleanup Worktrees

Remove references to deleted worktrees:

```bash
gwt prune
```

## Shell Integration

For `gwt switch` to actually change your current directory, you need to add a shell function wrapper.

Shell integration scripts are provided in the [`shell-integration/`](shell-integration/) directory:

- **Fish**: [`shell-integration/fish.fish`](shell-integration/fish.fish)
- **Bash**: [`shell-integration/bash.sh`](shell-integration/bash.sh)
- **Zsh**: [`shell-integration/zsh.sh`](shell-integration/zsh.sh)

### Installation

Add to your shell configuration file:

```bash
# Fish (~/.config/fish/config.fish)
source /path/to/gwtree/shell-integration/fish.fish

# Bash (~/.bashrc)
source /path/to/gwtree/shell-integration/bash.sh

# Zsh (~/.zshrc)
source /path/to/gwtree/shell-integration/zsh.sh
```

Then reload your shell or run:
```bash
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish  # Fish
source ~/.bashrc                   # Bash
source ~/.zshrc                    # Zsh
```

See [`shell-integration/README.md`](shell-integration/README.md) for more details.

## How It Works

### Worktree Path Convention

When creating a worktree, `gwt` follows this naming convention:

```
../<current-dir>-<safe-branch-name>
```

For example:
- Current directory: `myproject`
- Branch: `feature/auth`
- Worktree path: `../myproject-feature-auth`

### Branch Detection

`gwt` automatically detects branches in this order:

1. **Default Branch**: Fetches from `git remote` (typically `main` or `master`)
2. **Base Branch**: Searches for `develop` → `master` → `main`
3. **Current Branch**: Uses current branch if no branch name provided

### Auto-Rebase

When creating a worktree with auto-rebase enabled (default), `gwt`:

1. Checks out the base branch
2. Pulls the latest changes
3. Checks out your branch
4. Rebases onto the base branch

This ensures your new worktree starts with the latest code.

### Environment File Copying

By default, `gwt` copies these files from the source worktree:

- `.env`
- `.env.local`
- `.env.development`

You can disable this with the `--no-env` flag.

## Examples

### Basic Workflow

```bash
# Start working on a new feature
gwt add feature/user-profile

# Your worktree is created, .env is copied, and branch is rebased
# You're now in: ../myproject-feature-user-profile

# Work on your feature...
git add .
git commit -m "Add user profile page"

# Switch back to main worktree
gwt switch
# Select from interactive list

# Clean up when done
gwt delete
# Select the worktree to delete
```

### Working with Multiple Features

```bash
# Create worktrees for multiple features
gwt add feature/auth
gwt add feature/payments
gwt add bugfix/login-error

# List all worktrees
gwt list

# Switch between them as needed
gwt switch  # Interactive selection

# Sync any worktree with latest base
cd ../myproject-feature-auth
gwt sync
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Create worktree with custom settings
gwt add feature/advanced \
  --no-rebase \
  --no-env \
  --base develop \
  --path /custom/path/to/worktree

# Force delete a locked worktree
gwt delete /path/to/worktree --force

# Clean up after deleting worktrees manually
gwt prune
```
